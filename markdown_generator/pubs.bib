abstract = {Recently, we are witnessing a growing interest in the study of climate narratives and storylines. These are seen as critical tools both for improving shared understandings involving different stakeholders (including scientists from different disciplines) and guiding initiatives for transformative adaptation actions and decision making. This paper approaches the storylines about a severe drought event that took place in southeastern South America (SESA) in 2008/2009 from an interdisciplinary dialogue between climatologists and anthropologists. This approach responds to the need for a more robust understanding of the event and the responses adopted locally, i.e: not restricted to physical aspects but considering socio-economic and political aspects, with the aim of contributing to the development of socially relevant climatic information for realistic climate risk decision making contexts. In particular it intends to contribute to the decision-making processes of government agencies focused on climate communication and public climate services, such as national and weather services and regional agencies. Considering disciplinary differences, we account for the interpretative polyphony regarding this event, i.e.: what each actor/sector is talking about (for what and to whom they are talking about) when referring to "the drought", and analyze climate storylines as an agonistic field of meanings. This implies recognizing the disputes and contradictions among them, how different storylines promote certain lines of argumentation and meanings to the detriment of others, knowledge gaps, the role of social power relations, socio-political order factors and their impact in terms of the necessary transformations towards an environmentally sustainable and socially just horizon.},

@article{Bodnariuk2021,
abstract = {The latitude of separation of the Brazil Current (LSBC) variability is analyzed with a view to unveiling the physical mechanisms that modulate the turning point of the Brazil Current at low frequencies. The global ocean reanalysis ORAP5.0 spanning the period 1979–2013 is employed for this purpose. Three characteristic periodicities of the LSBC variability are found on the basis of a Singular Spectrum Analysis: 2, 4 and 10 years. Lagged sea surface height (SSH) correlation maps relate these modulations to Rossby wave propagation. According to these maps, the biennial signal might be triggered by the Atlantic Ni{\~{n}}o and the Indian Ocean Dipole. In the last case, SSH anomalies propagate around the southern tip of Africa, connecting the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Correlation maps suggest that the 4-year signal is triggered by both the Atlantic Ni{\~{n}}o and the ENSO in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The ENSO-related anomalies travel through the Indonesian Throughflow along the western Australian coast, where Rossby waves are excited. These anomalies propagate to the eastern coast of Madagascar and feed into the Agulhas Current, eventually leaking into the Atlantic basin. Finally, the decadal signal is associated to the leading mode of decadal variability of the South Pacific Ocean. SSH propagating patterns derived from ORAP5.0 data are also obtained with satellite altimetry during the overlapping period (1993–2013), which strengthens confidence in our results. The association of the LSCB modulations to characteristic climate variability modes suggests that the position of the LSCB could be predicted.},

abstract = {The large-scale extratropical circulation in the Southern Hemisphere is much more zonally symmetric than that of the Northern Hemisphere, but its zonal departures, albeit highly relevant for regional impacts, have been less studied. In this study we analyse the joint variability of the zonally asymmetric springtime stratospheric and tropospheric circulation using Complex Empirical Orthogonal Functions (cEOF) to characterise planetary waves of varying amplitude and phase. The leading cEOF represents variability of a zonal wave 1 in the stratosphere that correlates slightly with the Symmetric Southern Annular Mode (S-SAM). The second cEOF (cEOF2) is an alternative representation of the Pacific-South American modes. One phase of this cEOF is also very highly correlated with the Asymmetric SAM (A-SAM) in the troposphere. Springs with an active ENSO tend to lock the cEOF2 to a specific phase, but have no consistent impact on its magnitude. Furthermore, we find indications that the location of Pacific Sea Surface Temperature anomalies affect the phase of the cEOF2. As a result, the methodology proposed in this study provides a deeper understanding of the zonally asymmetric springtime extratropical SH circulation.},

abstract = {The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the main mode of variability in the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropical circulation and it is so called because of its zonally symmetric ring-like shape. However, the SAM pattern actually contains noticeable deviations from zonal symmetry. Thus, the purpose of this study is to describe the zonally asymmetric and symmetric components of the SAM variability and their impacts. We regress monthly geopotential height fields at each level onto the asymmetric and symmetric component of the SAM to create two new indices: Asymmetric SAM (A-SAM) and Symmetric SAM (S-SAM). In the troposphere, the A-SAM is associated with a zonal wave 3 which is rotated a quarter wavelength with respect to the climatological zonal wave 3, is much stronger in the Pacific ocean, where it extends vertically to the stratosphere with an equivalent barotropic structure. On the other hand, the S-SAM is associated with negative geopotential height anomalies over Antarctica surrounded by a zonally symmetric ring of positive geopotential height anomalies. The observed relationship between the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation and the SAM is fully explained by the A-SAM index. The positive trend of the SAM is present only in its symmetric component. Despite this, the SAM is becoming more zonally asymmetric. The regional impacts of the SAM in temperature and precipitation are strongly affected by its asymmetric component. We show that the asymmetric component of the SAM has its own unique variability, trends and impacts, some of these signals are only evident when the two SAM components are separated.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of a set of large ensembles (LE) of Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations from the Multi-Model Large Ensemble Archive, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and database for Policy Decision making for Future climate change in reproducing the variability and change of the austral summer precipitation observed in South America along the second part of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st. LE show similar biases in the mean austral summer rainfall and interannual variability than those detected in previous model sets, such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The positive trends in south-eastern South America (SESA) and negative ones in the southern Andes (SAn), that are the most significant observed regional features, are identified to some extent in LE simulations. The negative trend in SAn is a feature consistently shown among different models. For all models, mean trend is negative in that particular region and larger than the inter-member dispersion for each large ensemble. Trend magnitudes in the SESA region show a larger dispersion between models than the SAn region. While the mean trend among models is consistent with the observations, models underestimate the observed trend. The multi-model ensemble of selected models that best reproduce both mean and interannual variability features of rainfall in South America shows an 18% larger positive mean trend in SESA rainfall than those that have the worst performance. However, internal variability uncertainty is still higher than the mean trend for both sets of multi-model ensembles [5% (18%) for selected (non-selected) models]. Improvements in the representation of the main features of mean rainfall and variability are needed in order to better describe and reduce the uncertainties associated with the main climate change related signals in the continent.},

abstract = {Large climate variations have been detected from paleoclimatic records in some regions of South America during the last 500 years. Among them, the Altiplano and the subtropical Andes regions exhibited wetter-than-normal conditions during the 17th century within the paleoclimatic period known as Little Ice Age (LIA). On the other hand, both regions experienced drier-than-normal conditions in the second part of the 20th century in association with the recent global warming period (GWP). This study provides an assessment of the ability of four models of the third phase of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP3)/fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) experiments in reproducing those regional rainfall changes and the associated large-scale circulation features. Climate models can represent qualitatively the temperature changes observed in South America in both periods, LIA and GWP, as compared to the control run, but they do not properly describe the associated precipitation changes. However, they can simulate, in some extent, the large-scale circulation changes that previous works identified as important in driving the precipitation changes in both regions. Therefore, the assessment allows to detect the following changes in LIA (GWP): (a) equatorwards (polewards) displacement of the southern branch of the Hadley cell, in turn associated with wetter (drier) conditions in subtropical south America; (b) negative (positive) upper-level zonal wind changes related with positive (negative) December, January and February (DJF) rainfall changes in the Altiplano; and (c) positive (negative) low-level zonal wind changes associated to positive (negative) JJA rainfall changes in the subtropical Andes, being in turn related to hemispheric wind changes resembling a negative (positive) phase of the southern annular mode.},

The overarching goal of the Lighthouse Activity on Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change is to develop an integrated capability to understand, attribute, and predict annual to decadal changes in the Earth system, including capabilities for early warning of potential high impact changes and events. This article provides an overview of both the scientific challenges that must be addressed, and the research and other activities required to achieve this goal. The work is organized in three thematic areas: (i) monitoring and modeling Earth system change; (ii) integrated attribution, prediction, and projection; and (iii) assessment of current and future hazards. Also discussed are the benefits that the new capability will deliver. These include improved capabilities for early warning of impactful changes in the Earth system, more reliable assessments of meteorological hazard risks, and quantitative attribution statements to support the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update and State of the Climate reports issued by the World Meteorological Organization.},

abstract = {The concept of resilience has gained immense popularity as a way to frame social and environmental challenges. However, its empirical operationalization and the integration of social and ecological dimensions continue to present difficulties. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies of resilience in social, ecological and social-ecological systems (SESs) and examine how and to what extent these studies have achieved the operationalization of the concept of resilience. We evaluate the operationalization of resilience in 463 papers based on whether they define the system of interest and disturbances, whether they define resilience, whether they evaluate resilience, and for papers focusing on SESs, whether that evaluation integrates social and ecological dimensions. We find that 51% of empirical studies do not meet at least one of these operationalization criteria, and that even those that do often lack key features for effective operationalization, such as clear system boundaries and baseline state or an effective integration of social and ecological dimensions. Of the papers examining SESs and evaluating resilience, only 54% integrate social and ecological dimensions in that evaluation. Building on these findings, we propose some design guidelines for operationalizing future empirical studies of resilience. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.},

abstract = {Weather and climate variations on subseasonal to decadal time scales can have enormous social, economic, and environmental impacts, making skillful predictions on these time scales a valuable tool for decision-makers. As such, there is a growing interest in the scientific, operational, and applications communities in developing forecasts to improve our foreknowledge of extreme events. On subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scales, these include high-impact meteorological events such as tropical cyclones, extratropical storms, floods, droughts, and heat and cold waves. On seasonal to decadal (S2D) time scales, while the focus broadly remains similar (e.g., on precipitation, surface and upper-ocean temperatures, and their effects on the probabilities of high-impact meteorological events), understanding the roles of internal variability and externally forced variability such as anthropogenic warming in forecasts also becomes important. The S2S and S2D communities share common scientific and technical challenges. These include forecast initialization and ensemble generation; initialization shock and drift; understanding the onset of model systematic errors; bias correction, calibration, and forecast quality assessment; model resolution; atmosphere-ocean coupling; sources and expectations for predictability; and linking research, operational forecasting, and end-user needs. In September 2018 a coordinated pair of international conferences, framed by the above challenges, was organized jointly by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the World Weather Research Programme (WWRP). These conferences surveyed the state of S2S and S2D prediction, ongoing research, and future needs, providing an ideal basis for synthesizing current and emerging developments in these areas that promise to enhance future operational services. This article provides such a synthesis.},

In particular, total cloud cover (TCC) has both direct and indirect influence on agricultural production. Through dialogues with vegetable and rice producers of Northeastern Argentina (NEA), an important productive region in South-Eastern South America, the key role of cloud cover on crop yields was brought to the forefront. In this study, we present the climatology and observed long-term changes in TCC in NEA. The analyses are performed based on two independent datasets: TCC ground-based (GB) observations and satellite-based estimates from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). The datasets cover a common period, from December 1983 to November 2016 (Satellite Period), while GB TCC observations extend further, from March 1961 to February 2021 (GB Period). To facilitate a more comprehensive examination of GB TCC, we introduce a novel Cloud Index, expressed in a familiar unit (%), which allows the study of its temporal variations. TCC exhibits a distinct annual cycle and substantial spatial variability over NEA, consistently evident in both satellite and GB datasets. Over the Satellite Period (GB Period), we observed a decrease in NEA's TCC in both datasets (GB dataset), with seasonal variations and spatial heterogeneity. We ensured the reliability of our results by comparing the two datasets, which showed similar temporal variability, although the ISCCP Cloud Amount values were larger than the GB TCC. The described TCC climatology and observed changes have considerable implications for NEA's agricultural production and provide a robust foundation for future research. This article generates robust methodological basis for the analysis of this complex variable, a necessary step to explore the forcing of climate variability that modulates cloudiness in future research, and that could facilitate future studies in other regions of South America and the world.},

abstract = {Dynamical models are now widely used to provide forecasts of above or below average seasonal mean temperatures and precipitation, with growing interest in their ability to forecast climate extremes on a seasonal time scale. This study assesses the skill of the ENSEMBLES multi-model ensemble to forecast the 90th and 10th percentiles of both seasonal temperature and precipitation, using a number of metrics of 'extremeness'. Skill is generally similar or slightly lower to that for seasonal means, with skill strongly influenced by the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation. As documented in previous studies, much of the skill in forecasting extremes can be related to skill in forecasting the seasonal mean value, with skill for extremes generally lower although still significant. Despite this, little relationship is found between the skill of forecasting the upper and lower tails of the distribution of daily values.},

@article{Ruscica2022,
abstract = {Southeastern South America is subject to considerable precipitation variability on seasonal to decadal timescales and has undergone very heavy land-cover changes (LCCs) since the middle of the past century. The influence of local LCC and precipitation as drivers of regional evapotranspiration (ET) long-term trends and variability remains largely unknown in the region. Here, ensembles of stand-alone dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) with different atmospheric forcings are used to disentangle the influence of those two drivers on austral summer ET from 1950 to 2010. This paper examines the influence of both the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the dipole-like first-mode of southeastern South American precipitation variability (EOF1) on regional ET. We found that in the lower La Plata Basin, ET was driven by precipitation variability and showed a positive summer trend. Moreover, the region showed marked seasonal anomalies during El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a summers but mainly during EOF1 phases. On the contrary, in the upper La Plata Basin, LCCs forced the negative summer ET trend and particularly reduced the summer anomalies of the late 1990s, a period of ENSO and EOF1-positive phases. In the South Atlantic Convergence Zone region, the high ET uncertainty across ensemble members impeded finding robust results, which highlights the importance of using multiple DGVMs and atmospheric forcings instead of relying on single model/forcing results.},

@article{Saurral2020,
abstract = {The South Pacific Ocean is a key driver of climate variability within the Southern Hemisphere at different time scales. Previous studies have characterized the main mode of interannual sea surface temperature (SST) variability in that region as a dipolar pattern of SST anomalies that cover subtropical and extratropical latitudes (the South Pacific Ocean Dipole, or SPOD), which is related to precipitation and temperature anomalies over several regions throughout the Southern Hemisphere. Using that relationship and the reported low predictive skill of precipitation anomalies over the Southern Hemisphere, this work explores the predictability and prediction skill of the SPOD in near-term climate hindcasts using a set of state-of-the-art forecast systems. Results show that predictability greatly benefits from initializing the hindcasts beyond the prescribed radiative forcing, and is modulated by known modes of climate variability, namely El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Furthermore, the models are capable of simulating the spatial pattern of the observed SPOD even without initialization, which suggests that the key dynamical processes are properly represented. However, the hindcast of the actual phase of the mode is only achieved when the forecast systems are initialized, pointing at SPOD variability to not be radiatively forced but probably internally generated. The comparison with the performance of an empirical prediction based on persistence suggests that initialization may provide skillful information for SST anomalies, outperforming damping processes, up to 2–3 years into the future.},

@article{Vera2015,
abstract = {Austral summer rainfall trends are analysed over South America from observations and simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 between 1902 and 2005. Positive trends in southeastern South America (SESA) and negative ones in the southern Andes (SAn) are the most significant observed features. Mean trends obtained from an ensemble of 59 simulations from 14 models for the historical experiment (including both natural and anthropogenic forcings) are able to reproduce those precipitation changes, although weaker than observed. Most of the simulations reproduce the right sign of the precipitation changes at both regions. However, associated uncertainty ranges (due to both inter-model dispersion and internal climate variability) are still large. Mean trends for the historical experiment are statistically distinguishable from those obtained for the natural-forcing-only experiment, which exhibit negligible mean values at both regions. Results allow concluding that the anthropogenic forcing has at least a partial contribution in explaining the precipitation changes observed in both SESA and SAn regions during the last century.},

abstract = {Changes in the summer rainfall and 200-hPa zonal winds (U200) in the South American Altiplano are studied from 1902 to 2018 using three different reanalysis datasets and simulations from 14 climate models of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). No significant trend in rainfall was identified from GPCC reanalysis data over that period. On the other hand, regional U200 trends estimated from 20C and ERA20C reanalyses and from CMIP5 Historical simulations are significant and positive over the 1902-2005 period. However, the trends seem to be dependent on the reanalysis dataset and period considered. While no significant U200 trend is detected in simulations forced only by external natural sources, the mean trend is positive and significant in simulations forced only by the increment of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a signal associated with the anthropogenic forcing of climate change has been detected in U200 trends in the Altiplano, but it is weak as compared with the internal climate variability. Singular value decomposition analyses based on both reanalyzed and simulated data were performed to describe the co-variability between rainfall in the Altiplano, regional U200 and global sea surface temperature (SST). The analysis confirms that negative rainfall anomalies in the Altiplano, associated with positive U200 anomalies, are related with positive SST anomalies mainly in the tropical Pacific-Indian Oceans. Simulations can reproduce observed relationships and confirm that natural variability explains the observed year-to-year variability. Simulations also confirm that anthropogenic forcing is a necessary condition to explain the positive trends detected in the co-variability between tropical SST and regional U200 anomalies. However, the large influence exerted by the South American Monsoon over the region can also affect sign and magnitude of the changes in the Altiplano. No significant relationship was found from CMIP5 simulations between poleward displacements of the global Hadley cell and regional U200 changes. Instead, South American Hadley cell displacements are significantly correlated with regional U200 changes. The latter might be an additional evidence of the combined influence of both tropical surface ocean and South America Monsoon on the circulation changes in the Altiplano in the global warming context.},
