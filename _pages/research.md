Subseasonal Preditability of North Atlantic-European Weather Regimes and its applications in the energy sector
======

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Weather regimes are quasi-stationary, recurring and persistent large-scale patterns which modulates the surface weather variability on daily to weekly timescales. Weather regimes can be a useful predictor in a range of applications, in particular, the energy sector. Understanding the predictability of weather regimes on subseasonal timescales can help anticipate the evolution of weather for days up to weeks ahead.

In my research I focused on the year-round North Atlantic-European weathe regimes defined by [Grams and co-authors](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3338) to address the following questions: 1) Can forecast systems skillfuly forecast weather regimes weeks ahead. 2) What are the difference in performance between forecast systems? 3) What are the sources of errors in the weather regime forecasts?
