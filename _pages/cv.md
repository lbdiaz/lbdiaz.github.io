## Projects


### Current Projects

Impact of the Southern Annular Mode dynamics and its joint influence with other large-scale climate patterns in the South American Climate. PI: Marisol Osman. 

Interactions between multiple large-scale climate patterns and their impacts in South American Climate. Institution: University of Buenos Aires. PI: Carolina Vera

CLIMAX (Climate Services Through Knowledge Co-Production: A Euro-South American Initiative for Strengthening Societal Adaptation Response to Extreme Events). PI: Carolina Vera. 

### Past Projects

I led 1 project funded by the University of Buenos Aires. I have participated as a PhD student in 4 projects funded by local and international institutions.


## Cooperation Agreements

I signed an agreement with the Argentine Meteorological Service to implement the seasonal forecast system developed during my PhD and Postdoc.


## Experience as Reviewer

Guest Editor Special Issue on "Subseasonal to Decadal Predictions in support of Climate Services". Climate Services Journal. March 2021 - present.

Member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of the Southern Hemisphere Earth System Sciences. July 2021 - present.

Revision of articles submitted to Journal of Climate, Tellus, Meteorological Applications, Climate Dynamics, Advanced in Science and Research, International Journal of Climatology, Revista Brasileira de Meteorologia and Meteorológica.

Reviewer of the First Order Draft and Second Order Draft of the IPCC WGI AR6.

## Other Activities

Joint Monthly Climate Briefings: In collaboration with the Argentina National Weather Service (SMN) the Department of Atmospheric and Ocean Science (DCAO) and CIMA I co-organize the joint  CIMA-DCAO-SMN monthly climate briefing to present and discuss with the academic and operational weather and climate community the past climate conditions responsible for the climate anomalies observed in Argentina and South America. I participate and co-organize this activity since August 2011.

Member of the Executive Committee of [YESS](http://yess-community.org) (Young Earth System Scientist) community. YESS, the Young Earth System Scientists community, is an interdisciplinary early career scientists network. YESS community unifies international and multidisciplinary early career scientists in a powerful network, providing a voice and leverage for a better future to serve society. As an Executive Committee member I’m  responsible for maintaining and guiding YESS activities and working groups.

I have co-organized 2 international workshops for ECRs in the past 3 years.

I made short visits to the NOAA Climate Prediction Center, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, MeteoFrance and CPTEC to learn about the forecast tools and practices in those institutions.

Academic Visitor at the University of Reading. Supervisor: Ted Shepherd. From April to June of 2019.
